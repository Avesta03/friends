## All Notes Go Here

If you want to make a page manually instead of using Rails generator (rails g) you need three things:
1. Page itself
2. Controller
3. Route 

- <%= %> if you want it to output onto the screen
- <% %> if you don't (like, for loops or if/else statements)

<%= render "form", friend: @friend %>
- Calls form partial.

- Website can be hosted on Heroku.
